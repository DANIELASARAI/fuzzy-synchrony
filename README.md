Fuzzy Synchrony
==================

This is my refix of @jonobr1's Neuronal-Synchrony project.

I want to:
* Document the code
* Break it into smaller pieces
* Make my own animations
* Upload my own sounds

:smile:

### History

A collection of two dimensional animations that are triggered by sound.
